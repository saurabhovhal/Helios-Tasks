AWS RDS Cluster Setup and Management. 




 Step 1: Sign in to AWS Console
- Navigate to the RDS Dashboard (https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/).




 Step 2: Launch DB Cluster


- Click on "Create database".
- Choose Amazon Aurora as the engine.
- Choose either Aurora MySQL.
- Select Amazon Aurora with Aurora Replicas (replication-enabled).






 Step 3: Specify DB Cluster Settings


- DB Cluster Identifier
- Master Username & Password
- Instance Class (Writer & Reader nodes can be assigned different classes) 




 Step 4: Configure Connectivity


- Choose VPC, Subnet group, and Public Access.
- Set VPC security groups


 Step 5: Additional Configuration


- Database options: Initial database name (optional).
- Enable encryption, backup, monitoring as needed.


Step 6: Launch 


- Click "Create database" to launch the cluster.




2. Creating a Database in RDS Cluster 


Once the cluster is available:


- Connect using an SQL client with the endpoint, username, and password.
- Run SQL command: 
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
Alternatively, use AWS RDS Query Editor (Aurora-compatible versions only).


 3. Adding Writer and Reader Instances 


Add Writer:
- Only one writer is allowed in a cluster (Aurora).


 Add Reader:
- Navigate to RDS Console > Databases > Your Cluster- Click "Add reader".
- Choose instance class and other parameters.
- Click "Add reader" to launch.




4. Reader Endpoint vs Writer Endpoint
- Writer Endpoint: Used for write operations.
 - Reader Endpoint: Used for read operations, load balanced across replicas.


 5. Scaling Readers (Aurora Auto Scaling) 


Option 1: Manually Add/Remove Readers
- Use "Add reader" to manually scale.
- To remove, delete the replica instance
        
         Option 2: Aurora Auto Scaling 
1. Go to RDS Console > Databases > Cluster
2. Select the Reader Auto Scaling tab. 
3. Configure policies: 
- Min/Max replicas 
- CPU utilization or custom CloudWatch metrics


         AWS auto-scales read replicas based on policies.
